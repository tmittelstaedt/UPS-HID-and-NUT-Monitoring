This Repository contains a mix of Python scripts written for MacOS, Python scripts written for Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server, and Powershell scripts written for Windows.  There are multiple sets of scripts here.

The first set is for monitoring UPS devices that are plugged into these operating systems via USB and are recognized by the native UPS monitoring of those operating systems, they extend the basic monitoring supplied by the operating system as well as offer shutdown if the UPS goes on battery and the native monitoring does not offer shutdown.

Native UPS USB shutdown

Windows, MacOS & Ubuntu Desktop all will autodetect the USB bus on boot looking for a UPS connected via USB.  If the UPS implements the HID Power Devices. Power Device Page (x84) defined by the USB Implementers Forum, Inc. on usb.org, then these OSes will attach drivers to the USB vendor and product ID.

MacOS will then access a detected USB from its System Preferences -> Energy Saver -> UPS button.  This desktop configuration permits configuration of shutdown options.

Windows will access a detected UPS from it's System -> Power & battery (Power & Sleep) Settings.  This driver only pays attention to whether or not the UPS is Online to AC power or On Battery, when On Battery is detected, it can be set to put the machine to sleep after a few minutes.  (effectively it treats the UPS the same as it treats a laptop that is battery) If the UPS reports very low battery a modern Windows OS will transition from S0 (sleep) to S4 (hibernate)

Ubuntu Desktop will check the /etc/UPower/UPower.conf.d/ directory for a configuration snippit that can be configured to shut the system down when it goes on UPS.

There are two problems with these vendor-included UPS monitoring schemes:

1.  Some vendors do not implement data properly according to the HID Power Devices Power Device Page, as a result unless the operating system vendor has put code specifically in for those UPSes they will report missing, partial, or incorrect data.  Minuteman, Triplite & Cyberpower UPSes have all been reported to have problems or work on some versions of MacOS and not later versions and so on.
2.  These vendor-supplied programs have no way of distributing UPS status to other computers, so for large UPSes that have many computers plugged into them, only 1 computer will be able to monitor the UPS and shut down.

This is why the 2 major UPS monitoring software packages,  NUT and apcupsd, were written.

Many also offer a JSON server mode where UPS status of the connected UPS is made available over the network in a read-only manner

The second scripts are NUT (Network UPS Tools) client monitoring scripts, these scripts query a NUT server and can replace programs like WinNUT and shut the system down if the remote NUT server reports the UPS is on battery

The third are JSON client scripts that monitor the JSON servers created by the first group to shut down the device they are on, if the JSON server reports the UPS has gone on battery.

There are also 2 "bridge" scripts that run on either an apcupsd or NUT server and create a JSON server that reports UPS status read only.  The purpose of these are to allow queries from the JSON client scripts if the user has an operating system that cannot run any of the NUT or APCupsd client scripts and just wants to make a simple JSON query.

None of these are executable software programs so as to allow easy user modification, easy bug fixes, and avoid the security requirements of executable programs on some operating systems and to make their operation completely transparent for easy security auditing by the user. 

One of the problems with using a UPS on many operating systems is that the operating system will detect the UPS on boot and connect a driver to it, if the UPS follows the USB HID standard.
That driver is generally extremely limited.  For example on MacOS it will show that a UPS such as an APC BackUPS CS is connected but it will not show voltage or frequency, it
will only show if the UPS is powered by battery or wall AC power.   Apple also blocks attempts to unload the driver.  Windows will not even show that a UPS is connected instead
it shows a green battery icon in the tray, which will either switch status to on battery or not on battery and if the UPS runs out of power, Windows default is to hibernate the PC
instead of shutting it down - just like a laptop.  While Windows allows a local admin to unload the USB driver for the UPS it will immediately reload it on boot.   Also, these
default drivers do not have any method of communicating UPS status over the network to any other host.   So, a large UPS that multiple PCs are plugged into, cannot be used to gracefully shut all of those machines down.  UPS manufacturers who offer UPS shutdown software often charge for versions of it that allow for distributed shutdown information.

Commercial software for UPSes generally takes the approach that control of an individual UPS on an individual computer is free, and often manufacturer's software to do this is free.  But any software that allows for a single PC to communicate status to multiple PCs plugged into the same UPS is considered commercial and costs, and worse nowadays is that there is sometimes a subscription fee.   In addition, manufacturers will not keep their software packages updated for newer operating systems once their model of UPS they wrote it for is no longer being sold.

All of the programs here are scripts so the computer owner can easily modify them to accommodate different models of UPS.  See the documentation files

These were all debugged on the oldest, simplest, cheapest UPSes I could find with UPS monitoring ports that speak UPS USB HID.  There are some very proprietary UPSes that do
have USB monitoring ports that are completely proprietary and use protocols that are alien to USB HID UPS.  These scripts do not support that.

Network parameters available via the JSON servers are simple, just enough to enable networked shutdown.

The following files are contained here:

simple-ups-server.py    Python server that queries a USB connected UPS for status and makes that status available via a JSON query.  For Macintosh

Shutdown-Monitor-Mac.py   Desktop cient program that queries a JSON server for UPS status and shuts the system down if the UPS loses AC power.  For Macintosh

query-apc-on-usb.py    Diagnostic program to see if a USB-connected UPS is compatible with Monitor-UPS.ps1.  For Macintosh

ups_monitor.py   Desktop program that creates an icon on a Macintosh desktop the user can click on and get status of the UPS, as well as making a JSON server available. For Macintosh

GetUPSStatusNUT.py  Desktop program for the iMac that creates an icon on an Apple Macintosh desktop that the user can click on and get status of a UPS on a NUT server and will shut down the iMac if the NUT UPS goes on battery.  This is a NUT client.  For Macintosh

GetUPSStatusNUT.py.README.html  documentation for GetUPSStatusNUT.py

Monitor-UPS.ps1   Desktop program that creates an icon on a Windows desktop the user can click on and get status of the UPS, as well as making a JSON server available.  It can also monitor a remote NUT server and shut down the PC if the UPS goes on battery  For Windows

Monitor-UPS-ReadInfo.ps1  Command line test diagnostic program that reads a USB-connected UPS to see if it is compatible with Monitor-UPS.ps1.    For Windows

ubuntu_ups_monitor.py  Python script for Ubuntu Desktop that hooks into the upower program that is included in Ubuntu Desktop and provides a JSON server for a USB UPS HID connected UPS, this puts a status indicator icon on the desktop that it is running

ubuntu_ups_info.py  Python script for Ubuntu Desktop that queries the upower/dbus program for stats for a USB UPS HID connected UPS, used for testing to see if the attached UPS will work

README-Ubuntu-UPS_monitor.html   HTML documentation for the ubuntu_ups_monitor.py script

ubuntuREADME-UPS_monitor.txt  textfile that is saved most likely in /root/UPS or other convenient location for use with the desktop icon to provide a readme menu for it
